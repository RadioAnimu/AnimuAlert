# AnimuAlert
A node script used for notifying about live programs, sends to a Discord channel (via Webhooks, using the discord.js library)
and Twitter (via the API, using the twitter-api-v2 library)

The code is extremely focused on the radio api and its quirks but can be adapted for other uses if need be.

To run, just setup the variables on the config file and npm run it.
